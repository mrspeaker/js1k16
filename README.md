# This is where your demo goes

<a href="http://mrspeaker.github.io/js1k16/">A demo by Mr Speaker</a>. Use headphones for
optimal enjoyment. Was supposed to be for js1k, but I don't think I could
have squashed it to 1k and still kept the lovely prose.

Uses the speechSynthesis API for singing, and Web Audio API for the beautiful
melodies. The crazed voice sounds much cooler in Firefox, which for some
reason gets quite a few notes higher than Chrome. Ah well.
